                <h2>We Develop the Next Generation of Sten</h2>
                <p class="para"> Fluid Biotech is commercializing the first bioabsorbable brain stent to cure aneurysms. Brain aneurysms afflict up to 5%
                of people and can lead to devastating stroke. The company team of neurosurgeons, scientists, and engineers has designed
                the world’s first hybrid polymer-metal flow-diverting stent to cure this deadly disease. Uniquely constructed of
                dissolving polymer and metal, this innovative medical device provides a scaffold to allow better healing and
                visualization of blood vessels.</p>

                    <p>
        
                        Using familiar and standard techniques, the physician will navigate our proprietary stent delivery
                        system to bypass the
                        aneurysm under angiographic guidance. Our stent is highly flexible, and will self-expand after release
                        so it does not
                        require a balloon to deploy.

                    <h3>Blood Flow Diverted from Aneurysm</h3>
                    <p>
        
        
                        As blood flow slows down inside the weak area of the blood vessel, the aneurysm will gradually thrombose
                        over time thus
                        protecting the patient from the risk of rupture and stroke. Blood flow is maintained to normal areas of
                        the brain. The
                        unique construction of our hybrid polymer-metal stent confers excellent flow-diversion properties that
                        compares to or
                        exceeds the performance of regular metal flow-diverters available in the marketplace, as shown in our
                        laboratory data.

                        The majority of our stent is made of a polymer that provides a scaffold for endothelial cells to promote
                        blood vessel
                        healing. After the aneurysm is cured, our stent gradually is absorbed into the blood vessel wall thus
                        leaving very
                        little footprint behind. Because polymer is invisible to x-rays and eventually dissolves away, there is
                        minimal
                        interference with follow-up CT and MRI scans so patients are not required to undergo invasive angiogram
                        tests, and there
                        is no necessity for life-long blood thinners.
