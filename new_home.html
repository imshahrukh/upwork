                        <h1>We Develop the Next Generation of Sten</h1>
                        <p>Fluid Biotech is commercializing the first bioabsorbable brain stent to cure aneurysms. Brain aneurysms
                            afflict up to 5% of people and can lead to devastating stroke. The company team of neurosurgeons,
                            scientists, and engineers has designed the world’s first hybrid polymer-metal flow-diverting stent to
                            cure this deadly disease. Uniquely constructed of dissolving polymer and metal, this innovative medical
                            device provides a scaffold to allow better healing and visualization of blood vessels.

                                        As blood flow slows down inside the weak area of the blood vessel, the aneurysm will gradually thrombose
                                        over time thus
                                        protecting the patient from the risk of rupture and stroke. Blood flow is maintained to normal areas of
                                        the brain. The
                                        unique construction of our hybrid polymer-metal stent confers excellent flow-diversion properties that
                                        compares to or
                                        exceeds the performance of regular metal flow-diverters available in the marketplace, as shown in our
                                        laboratory data.

                                    The majority of our stent is made of a polymer that provides a scaffold for endothelial cells to promote
                                    blood vessel
                                    healing. After the aneurysm is cured, our stent gradually is absorbed into the blood vessel wall thus
                                    leaving very
                                    little footprint behind. Because polymer is invisible to x-rays and eventually dissolves away, there is
                                    minimal
                                    interference with follow-up CT and MRI scans so patients are not required to undergo invasive angiogram
                                    tests, and there
                                    is no necessity for life-long blood thinners.

                        <p>Fluid Biotech is committed to the development of a radically new bioabsorbable flow-diverting stent in the
                        race to cure
                        brain aneurysms. Our self-expanding stent is engineered to be highly flexible to navigate into delicate
                        blood vessels of
                        the brain. The unique use of polymer in our stent allows better healing of blood vessels while minimizing
                        interference
                        with radiological tests. As the company founders are academic specialists as well as practicing
                        neurosurgeons, we are
                        optimizing the medical device for patient safety, treatment efficacy, and physician ease-of-use.
