            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>
                Fluid Biotech is a medical device start-up founded by two neurosurgeons at the University of Calgary that has developed
                an implantable dissolving stent to divert blood flow and heal blood vessels. The desire to innovate and create positive
                change has always been a priority for the founders and inventors, Dr. John Wong and Dr. Alim Mitha. Working together for
                the past two decades to help people with stroke, their drive and commitment to improve patient health sparked a vision
                to create a radical new stent to cure brain aneurysms without invasive surgery.

            <h5>OUR RESEARCH</h5>
            <h1>From Concept to Reality</h1>
            <div class="res-top">
                <p>
                    Guided by their clinical experience in the operating room towards a goal of minimizing side effects and complications,
                    years of research and development in Dr. Mitha’s biomedical engineering laboratory has made the concept a reality. The
                    company has transitioned the stent from proof of concept towards final prototyping and validation of their unique
                    technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    
                    With the support of its partners, Fluid Biotech is achieving significant scientific, regulatory, and financing
                    milestones along the pathway of product development. Fluid Biotech is well positioned to disrupt the stent market, and
                    ultimately improve the quality of life and well-being of patients everywhere.

                Dr. Wong received his medical education and neurosurgical training at the University of Alberta. After a one-year
                fellowship in neurovascular surgery at Yale University and further two-year specialization in interventional
                neuroradiology in New York City, he was recruited to Calgary in 2001. Since then, he has helped develop one of the most
                collaborative and productive neurovascular and stroke units in North America with colleagues in neurology, radiology,
                and neurosurgery.
                <br>
                <br>
                Dr. Wong has co-authored numerous peer-reviewed manuscripts and has served on several grant review panels including for
