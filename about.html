                    <p class="para ps"> 
                        Fluid Biotech is a medical device start-up founded by two neurosurgeons at the University of Calgary that has developed
                        an implantable dissolving stent  to divert blood flow and heal blood vessels. The desire to innovate and create positive
                        change has always been a priority for the founders and inventors, Dr. John Wong and Dr. Alim Mitha. Working together for
                        the past two decades to help people with stroke, their drive and commitment to improve patient health sparked a vision
                        to create a radical new stent to cure brain aneurysms without invasive surgery.

                            Guided by their clinical experience in the operating room towards a goal of minimizing side effects and complications,
                            years of research and development in Dr. Mitha’s biomedical engineering laboratory has made the concept a reality. The
                            company has transitioned the stent from proof of concept towards final prototyping and validation of their unique
                            technology.

                        degree in
                        Cellular and Molecular Biology at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and after graduating from
                        medical
                        school at
                        the University of Alberta, completed his residency training in Neurosurgery at the University of
                        Calgary.
                        During that
                        time, he also completed a Masters of Science degree with a focus on Biomedical Engineering at Harvard
                        University and a
                        research fellowship at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
